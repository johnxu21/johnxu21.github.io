Frequently Asked Questions
=========

### General
* I have no idea how to find a group.
  * During the first weeks, try to ask around who is still without a group.
  * You may form a group of 10 (subject to motivation);
  * You may also (subject to motivation) deviate from the permitted group classification. But then it should be clear to everyone that the expertise in the group is not entirely equal.
  * If you have not found a partner by the 2nd week of the class, please contact <em></em><a href="mailto:john.businge@unlv.edu">Prof. John Businge</a> by email or on the Discord Server. We will collect all the names of individuals who have not yet found anyone and then put you in touch with each other.
* Can we also do the first practicals at home? Is it mandatory to come to the physical practicals? 
  * It is not mandatory to come to the physical practicals.
  * We like to physically organize the first three practicals because we can easily help with technical problems during the installation and use of the software libraries. Once the setup of your project is done, you can independently start the real programming.
* Can we still come to the practicals every week?
  * Yes, the computer lab is available for you to work on the project together.
* Do we still get theory lessons?
  * No. The theory lessons are only during the first seven weeks.
  * What if a group mate gives up?
  * Contact us as soon as possible. (By the way, this applies to all problems you might have with your group mates) Then we look for an individual solution.
* **How many pull requests (PRs) are needed to earn full points?**
  * The minimum requirement per Design Portfolio (DP) is 3 meaningful PRs.
  * However, full credit is typically earned with 4–6 well-executed PRs per DP, depending on team and cross-team comparisons.
  * 80–85% of the time, 4–5 strong PRs are enough for full points.
  * Keep in mind that peer reviews and issue discussions also count heavily toward your grade—balance is key!
* **How many PR reviews and issue discussions are needed to earn full points?**
  * The minimum requirement per Design Portfolio (DP) is 3 meaningful PR reviews and at least 1 issue discussion.
  * Full credit is generally awarded for 4–6 well-executed PR reviews and 1–2 thoughtful issue discussions, but this is not a fixed threshold.
  * 80–85% of the time, 4–5 strong PR reviews combined with active participation in issue discussions are enough for full points.
  * Final evaluation is based on overall contribution quality and team/cross-team comparisons, rather than a strict number.  
  * As with pull requests, the **quality of engagement** matters more than quantity, your feedback should be constructive, relevant, and context-aware.
