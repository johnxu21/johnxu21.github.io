# **Introduction to ChatGPT in Software Engineering**

In this lab, you'll learn how to use ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, to tackle software engineering tasks. ChatGPT, part of the GPT family, can generate human-like text based on input and has become a valuable tool for developers. Throughout the lab, you'll explore how developers incorporate ChatGPT into their workflow and learn how to use it responsibly to improve productivity.

This lab leverages results from our published research in the [2024 International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)](ASE_Paper_2024.pdf), where we studied the application of ChatGPT in industry, particularly in open-source projects. We provide insights into how ChatGPT impacts software engineering tasks and decision-making in real-world scenarios.

## **Overview of ChatGPT's Role in Software Engineering**

ChatGPT is widely used in various stages of the software development lifecycle, including requirements engineering, design, development, testing, and maintenance. Common uses include code generation, test creation, code review, and more.

A detailed description of how language models are applied in software engineering tasks can be found in **Section 6** of Hou et al. [LLMs for SE: A SLR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10620.pdf).

### The typical tasks include:

- **Requirements engineering**: e.g., requirements classification, resolving ambiguity
- **Software design**: e.g., GUI retrieval, rapid prototyping
- **Development**: e.g., code generation, search, documentation
- **Quality assurance**: e.g., test generation, bug detection
- **Maintenance**: e.g., code review, duplicate bug detection
- **Management**: e.g., effort estimation

### Scenarios and Themes from Industry

In our ASE paper, we explored several practical scenarios where developers use ChatGPT in GitHub pull requests:

1. **Patch Applied (PA)**: Developers apply code snippets generated by ChatGPT directly into their projects.
2. **Patch Not Applied (PN)**: Code snippets were discussed but not applied, or significantly modified.
3. **None Existing Patch (NE)**: Developers receive conceptual advice from ChatGPT without code snippets.

We conducted clone detection for PA scenarios to verify code integration, and for PN/NE cases, we used rigorous qualitative analysis to extract themes. Key themes included:

- **PN Themes**: Project adaptation, methodological guidance, specific functionality, technical limitations, and clarifications.
- **NE Themes**: Conceptual guidance, documentation improvement, education, debugging, and optimization strategies.

These findings illustrate how ChatGPT is used in practice and will help guide you in understanding the responsible and effective use of ChatGPT in software engineering.


## Patch Applied (PA)
### **Example 1: Code Duplication and Refactoring**

- [PR link](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/nostr-tools/pull/241)
- [ChatGPT Link](https://chat.openai.com/share/f09f38e5-f541-4f98-9483-e183f5650398)
- 
A developer used ChatGPT during the `Software maintenance` task of `code duplication and refactoring` in the `nostr-tools` project. The developer aimed to resolve code repetition and refactor the code.



The pull request shows code changes to address **duplication issues**, improving code quality. Code duplication often leads to maintenance challenges, bugs, and reduced readability. By using ChatGPT, the developer sought guidance to efficiently refactor the code.

**Developer Prompt:**
```text
I have some duplication in my TypeScript code. I want to resolve it by creating a discriminated union based on the keys and values of the interface. Is this possible?
```

### **Example 2: Deployment Documentation**

Links to PR and ChatGPT conversation:
- [PR Link](https://github.com/swarmion/swarmion/pull/678)
- [ChatGPT Conversation](https://chat.openai.com/share/7538b618-c08d-45b7-a4ed-bb168e9c1eb0)

Documentation plays a key role in ensuring effective communication and collaboration in software development. It can take various forms such as:
- **Requirements Documentation**: Specifications (functional & non-functional).
- **Design Documentation**: System architecture, data flow.
- **Technical Documentation**: Code, APIs, algorithms, and data.
- **Testing & QA Documentation**: Test plans and quality assurance.
- **Deployment Documentation**: Guidelines for software deployment.

In this case, the developer used ChatGPT to generate user-friendly, concise deployment documentation for the `release.sh` script. 

**Developer's prompt:**
```plaintext
Act as a developer advocate with 5 years of experience. Write quick documentation for this `release.sh` script. Use bullet points and short sentences. Add emojis where needed.
```

<p style="text-align:center">

</p>

<br />

As a result, the [`CONTRIBUTION.md`](https://github.com/swarmion/swarmion/pull/678/files#diff-eca12c0a30e25b4b46522ebf89465a03ba72a03f540796c979137931d8f92055) file was updated with documentation from ChatGPT to help new contributors get started.

</p>


### **Example 3: Configuring GitHub Actions Workflow**

- [PR link](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/pull/2405) - [Git Diff File](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/pull/2405/files#diff-1918769d4ce5178c72d08b74f069e98856eeddcb0391e5c39636c8c33051f7f9)
- [ChatGPT Conversation](https://chat.openai.com/share/8cb16814-2855-4fbd-87e5-bde8ba349728)

In Examples 1 and 2 above, the developer used the code generated by ChatGPT "as-is." However, this example demonstrates another use case where the developer integrates only a *portion* of the code snippet suggested by ChatGPT. The prompt provided by the developer aligns with the `Configuring GitHub Actions Workflow` task, which falls under the `Software Configuration Management (SCM)` activity. SCM encompasses version control, configuration management, and process management. Configuring GitHub Actions workflow specifically relates to automating the building, testing, and deploying of code changes, which aligns with CI practices.

In this case, after reviewing the GitHub link and ChatGPT conversation, we can see that the developer is seeking guidance on setting up and configuring `GitHub Actions workflows` for the `Faker.js` library. The GitHub link shows changes made to the `GitHub Actions workflow` configuration file.

**Developer Prompt 1:** 
```plaintext
Write a GitHub Action yml file that blocks the PR from merging when there is a label named "do NOT merge yet" or "s: on hold"
```

**Developer Prompt 2:**
```plaintext
How can I check "s: on hold" with "contains" using "github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name"
```
Below is the final code snippet generated by ChatGPT and the portion integrated into the GitHub pull request.

## **Patch Not Applied (PN)**

### **Example 1: Adaptation and Tailored Solutions**
This example shows how ChatGPT's conceptual advice was adapted for customized solutions to fit unique project needs.
- [PR link](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/core/pull/12)
- [ChatGPT link](https://chatgpt.com/share/e9555822-4ffb-4845-8e40-0bc6cbbc658d)

#### **Conversation Summary**
* **Initial ChatGPT Suggestion:** ChatGPT provided a regex for ULID: `^[0-9A-HJKMNP-TV-Z]{26}$` to match a 26-character string using base32 encoding.
* **Reviewer's Suggestion:** The reviewer (`@lindyhopchris`) recommended using Laravel's `whereUlid()` regex for consistency, aligning with how ULIDs are handled in the Laravel framework. 
The Laravel [regex](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/53b02b3c1d926c095cccca06883a35a5c6729773/src/Illuminate/Routing/CreatesRegularExpressionRouteConstraints.php#L48) provided by the reviewer is

    ```regex
    [0-7][0-9a-hjkmnp-tv-zA-HJKMNP-TV-Z]{25}
    ```

    This regex specifies that the first character is a digit between 0-7, followed by 25 base32 characters.

* **PR Author's Acceptance:** The author (@Ashk2a) acknowledged the feedback and updated the code (File [MatchedIDs.php](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/core/pull/12/files)) to reflect the Laravel-style regex:

    ```php
    public function ulid(): self
    {
        return $this->matchAs('[0-7][0-9a-hjkmnp-tv-zA-HJKMNP-TV-Z]{25}');
    }
    ```

#### **Conclusion**
This pull request demonstrates how the developer adapted ChatGPT’s suggested regex to meet the specific requirements of the project. The task falls under the Software Engineering activity of **code customization**, as the developer further modified the generated code to align with project standards and feedback. This aligns with the theme of **adaptation to project needs**, where conceptual advice from ChatGPT was tailored to ensure consistency with Laravel’s framework.


### **Example 2: Methodological Guidance**
This theme focuses on how **ChatGPT's advice informs approaches or refined solutions**, rather than being directly applied as patches. The emphasis is on broader strategies influenced by ChatGPT.

* [PR link](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/5063)
* [ChatGPT Link](https://chat.openai.com/share/2a6f10f0-d45d-4e71-ac57-584570baeda8)

The developer's interaction with ChatGPT in this pull request demonstrates a progression from a complex to a simpler, more efficient solution. Here's a breakdown:

#### **Initial Code (Before ChatGPT's Suggestion)**

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/teaching/CS472/Timetable/GPT/PN-EX-2.png" alt="ShareChatGPTConversations" style="max-width:710px;max-height:355px;" align="center"></p>

In the initial code, the developer uses `System.Char.ConvertToUtf32` to convert a `char` to its Unicode (UTF-32) code point. While effective, this method is mainly suited for handling UTF-16 surrogate pairs and is unnecessary for basic `char` values. It's an overly complex solution for ASCII or basic Unicode characters.

The reviewer (@pbiggar), after consulting ChatGPT, noted that casting the `char` to an `int` would achieve the same result in a simpler and more efficient way. **ChatGPT suggested casting `char` to `int`**, which directly returns the Unicode (or ASCII) code point for the character—perfect for most simple characters.

#### **Refined Code (After ChatGPT’s Suggestion)**
The refined code can be found in the file [backend/src/BuiltinExecution/Libs/Char.fs](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/5063/files#diff-2949d723a79b066aa811f68b3bc6f1aa712cf44b63c8210febd62378a408c536).

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/teaching/CS472/Timetable/GPT/PN-EX-2-2.png" alt="ShareChatGPTConversations" style="max-width:800px;max-height:175px;" align="center"></p>

In the updated version:
* **Simplified Conversion**: The developer replaced `System.Char.ConvertToUtf32` with `int c.[0]`, which is a simpler and direct way to get the integer (ASCII/Unicode) value of a character.
* **Added Validation**: Additional logic was included to handle edge cases:
  * **Digit Check**: The code checks if the character is a digit using `System.Char.IsDigit(c[0])`.
  * **Range Validation**: It verifies that `charValue` is within the `[0, 256)` range, ensuring the value is within the ASCII range.
  * **Conditional Handling**: If `charValue` is valid, it returns `Dval.optionSome (DInt charValue)`, otherwise it returns `Dval.optionNone`.

#### **Conclusion**
The interaction in this pull request is a clear example of **methodological guidance**, where ChatGPT’s advice helps refine the developer's approach instead of being directly applied as a patch. This refinement aligns with the Software Engineering task of **program repair**, as it involved simplifying and improving the initial code to address inefficiencies.

By following ChatGPT's advice, the developer made the code more efficient and easier to maintain, demonstrating how **methodological guidance** can lead to better solutions in software engineering.


## None Existing Patch (NE)
### **Example 1: Conceptual Guidance & Theoretical Advice**
This theme emphasizes programming concepts, design principles, and optimization strategies, focusing on best practices for readability and maintainability without specific code implementations.

- [PR link](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/frontend/pull/1061)
- [ChatGPT Link](https://chat.openai.com/share/d668d64c-182e-4e9d-8e17-6517d91fc65e)

Let's break down the situation to understand how the developer changed their code based on the ChatGPT conversation:

#### **Original Problem**
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/teaching/CS472/Timetable/GPT/NE-EX-1-1.png" alt="ShareChatGPTConversations" style="max-width:800px;max-height:325px;" align="center"></p>

The developer was using the variable name `pricingFrequencyClicked`, which was problematic because the name implied an action (a click) rather than a state (the selected frequency). This didn't accurately reflect what the variable was being used for: to store the **selected pricing frequency** (e.g., 'monthly' or 'yearly').

#### **Developer's Implementation**
The final updates in the PR can be viewed in the file: [app/controllers/pay.js](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/frontend/pull/1061/files#diff-430dcbc461b77b60fd320d970946d870ed279a2952a06350872de59304e427e8).

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/teaching/CS472/Timetable/GPT/NE-EX-1-2.png" alt="ShareChatGPTConversations" style="max-width:800px;max-height:55px;" align="center"></p>

After the ChatGPT conversation, the developer renamed `pricingFrequencyClicked` to `selectedPricingFrequency`. This new name more accurately reflects that the variable holds the user's selection for pricing frequency, improving both readability and maintainability of the code.

#### **ChatGPT's Advice**
ChatGPT highlighted the issue with the variable name, explaining that `pricingFrequencyClicked` was not appropriate because it didn't align with the variable's purpose. It suggested using a name like `selectedPricingFrequency` to more accurately reflect that the variable holds a selection, not an action.

#### **Conclusion**
This interaction falls under the **"Conceptual Guidance & Theoretical Advice"** theme, where ChatGPT's recommendations helped improve the clarity and maintainability of the code by suggesting better naming conventions. This aligns with the software engineering tasks of **code review** and **code quality enhancement**, as it involved refining naming practices to enhance readability and maintainability.

In this case, ChatGPT played a key role in informing the process of improving code structure and long-term maintainability, aligning with these software engineering tasks.


### **Example 2: Debugging and Optimization Strategies**
This theme focuses on debugging methods, performance optimization, and refining algorithms, offering strategic insights into problem-solving approaches without providing specific code snippets.

- [PR link](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/5068)
- [ChatGPT Link](https://chat.openai.com/share/7fe27ca4-5c0e-431b-953b-7f6e23710b5c)

Let's break down how the developer improved their code based on a conversation with ChatGPT:

#### **Original Code**
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/teaching/CS472/Timetable/GPT/NE-EX-2-1.png" alt="ShareChatGPTConversations" style="max-width:895px;max-height:446px;" align="center"></p>

Initially, the developer was using `pushBack`, which appends an element to the end of a list. However, repeatedly using this operation can be inefficient, as it may require traversing the entire list, especially in larger datasets.

#### **ChatGPT's Advice**
After consulting ChatGPT, the developer received a suggestion to optimize the list operation by switching to `push` (which likely adds elements to the front of the list) and then reversing the list at the end. This approach is generally more efficient because adding to the front of the list is an O(1) operation in many functional languages, whereas `pushBack` can be an O(n) operation, where n is the length of the list.

#### **Updated Code**
The optimized code can be found in this PR file: [backend/testfiles/execution/stdlib/result.dark](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/5068/files#diff-ad820db3a141ba69514679a4698e3acb98c351faa8e2aaca9c3511c2740b8c19).

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/teaching/CS472/Timetable/GPT/NE-EX-2-2.png" alt="ShareChatGPTConversations" style="max-width:676px;max-height:72px;" align="center"></p>

In this updated code:
- The developer switched to using `push` (adding to the front) and planned to reverse the list at the end.
- This new approach enhances performance, as adding to the front of the list is typically O(1), whereas using `pushBack` could result in O(n) complexity.

#### **Conclusion**
This interaction falls under the **Debugging & Optimization Strategies** theme, where ChatGPT provided advice to improve performance. Rather than directly offering a code solution, ChatGPT suggested a strategy—appending elements to the front of the list and reversing it later—to optimize performance. This aligns with the Software Engineering task of **performance optimization**, where the developer refined the algorithm based on ChatGPT's advice, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of the code.

ChatGPT played a key role in guiding the developer toward a more efficient solution for handling list operations, demonstrating how strategic advice can lead to performance improvements in software engineering.

   - Carefully read all the provided material, including the illustrative examples and case studies for:
     - **Patch Applied (PA)**
     - **Patch Not Applied (PN)**
     - **None Existing Patch (NE)**
   - For each case study, review the associated pull requests (PRs) and ChatGPT conversations to fully understand how ChatGPT was used to improve software engineering tasks, such as code refactoring, documentation, and debugging.

2. **Take Time to Understand**:
   - This task is designed to ensure you fully understand the material **before moving on to the hands-on exercises**.
   - Thoroughly review each example to see how ChatGPT has been integrated into the developer workflow and how it impacted the decision-making process.
   - **Rushing through this material can lead to confusion in later tasks**, so take the necessary time to digest the information.

3. ****Submit Reflection**:
   - After going through all the examples, write a **reflection of up to 300 words** that covers all three case studies (PA, PN, and NE).
   - Your reflection should include at least **two specific quotes or code snippets** from the material to support your analysis.
   - Explain how these examples illustrate ChatGPT’s role in improving code quality, decision-making, or problem-solving.

**Reminder**:
   - Ensure you thoroughly understand the material, as it will help you avoid confusion and make the hands-on exercises much easier to tackle.

## Task 2: Hands-on with ChatGPT

In **Task 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3**, you will work on your **team repository**, where previous lab tasks were submitted. You'll use ChatGPT to improve code quality, documentation, and comprehension. All code must be reviewed by at least one colleague, and both the author and the reviewer must use ChatGPT during the review process.

### **Organizational Guidelines**:
1. **Repository Structure**: Agree on folder names for each task and document them in your report. Add unique identifiers (e.g., your name) to filenames to avoid conflicts.
   - **Example**: `yourname_refactor_code.py`
2. **Pull Requests (PRs)**: Open PRs for each task with clear descriptions, including references to ChatGPT suggestions.
   - **Example**: "Refactored function X using ChatGPT's recommendation."
3. **Collaborative Review**: All PRs must be reviewed by at least one team member. The reviewer may use ChatGPT for insights if necessary and include the conversation link in the PR comments when relevant.
   - **Note**: The use of ChatGPT by the reviewer is **optional** and only required if it adds value to the review process.

### **Verification and Collaboration**:
1. **Testing**: Verify all changes and test thoroughly before submitting the PR.
2. **Peer Feedback**: Each PR must be independently reviewed. Reviewers should provide feedback on:
   - Code readability
   - Best practices
   - Functionality
   - **Learning Purpose**: Not all feedback needs to result in code changes. Sometimes, feedback is provided to help understand concepts. For example, in the "None Existing Patch (NE) – Concrete examples" from the class slides, the conversation about managing multi-architecture installations of Homebrew on Mac M1 systems enhanced understanding of specifying architecture flags and paths for x86_64 binaries. These insights help deepen knowledge without directly altering the code.
3. **Finalizing PRs**: After incorporating feedback, whether it results in code changes or just learning, update the PR with a summary and the ChatGPT conversation link. Merge only after the review is complete.

### **Google Sheet for Peer Review**:
- Use the Google Sheet (shared on **Discord**) to organize reviews. Indicate who will review which tasks (Task 2.1, 2.2, or 2.3).
   - Ensure each student’s work is reviewed at least once.
   - Update the sheet before starting the review process.
- **Reviewer Responsibilities**: Provide feedback using ChatGPT and share your ChatGPT conversation link in the PR comments.

## Task 2.4: Workflow Automation with GitHub Actions

**Objective**: Build upon your previous CI lab by improving the continuous integration (CI) pipeline using recommendations from ChatGPT.

### **Instructions**:

In this task, you will continue building the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline initiated in the previous lab on **Testing and CI**. All the code will be implemented in your individual **CI Lab** Repo (or fork).

1. **Review Existing Workflow**: Start by reviewing the CI workflow you created in the previous lab. Ensure that the current workflow has the following basic components:
   - Event triggers (push, pull request)
   - A job that runs on `ubuntu-latest`
   - Python 3.9 as the container
   - Steps for checking out the repository, installing dependencies, linting with `flake8`, and running unit tests with `pytest`

2. **Open an Issue for Improvements**: Open an issue in your individual repository to document potential improvements to the CI workflow. Consider areas such as:
   - Adding more automated tests
   - Enhancing code quality checks
   - Adding security analysis or vulnerability scanning
   - Testing on multiple platforms or environments

3. **Consult ChatGPT**: Ask ChatGPT for suggestions on how to improve your CI workflow. You can request recommendations for:
   - Adding more stages (e.g., code quality analysis, security checks)
   - Integrating third-party tools (e.g., `SonarQube` for code analysis, `Trivy` for security scanning)
   - Optimizing existing steps or adding new ones for improved workflow efficiency.

4. **Update Workflow**: Based on ChatGPT’s recommendations, modify the `workflow.yml` file to incorporate the improvements. Be sure to maintain functionality while enhancing the workflow.

5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: 
   - Submit a PR with the updated CI workflow to your individual repository.
   - Reference the issue you opened (e.g., "Closes #123") and describe the changes made, including any improvements based on ChatGPT’s suggestions.

6. **Test the Workflow**: Ensure that the updated CI workflow runs smoothly without any regressions. Use the GitHub Actions tab to verify that all jobs complete successfully.
   - Include any test results and the ChatGPT conversation link in the PR description to document the changes.

7. **Merge PR**: Once you have confirmed that the workflow improvements are successful and thoroughly tested, merge the PR into your main branch.


# Task 3: Summary Report

**Objective**:
Provide a brief summary of the work completed during the hands-on tasks and submit links to the relevant individual pull requests (PRs).

### **Instructions**:

1. **Task Summary**: 
   - For each task (Familiarizing with ChatGPT, Code Refactoring, Documentation Assistance, Understanding Complex Code, Workflow Automation), provide a short description (1-2 sentences) of what you did.
   - Include the link to the individual pull request (PR) for each task.

2. **Peer Review Summary** (for Tasks 2.1 to 2.3):
   - Briefly mention how you reviewed a colleague’s code using ChatGPT and how your code was reviewed.
   - Include any improvements made based on the review process.

### **Submission**:
- Submit your report on Web Campus.

**Note**: The report should be brief, focused on summarizing the work and including PR links.
