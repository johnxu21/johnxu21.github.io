Target Application
==============
[LinkedIn](https://github.com/linkedin/kafka) project is a variant fork of [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka) running at LinkedIn. 

Kafka was born at LinkedIn. The run thousands of brokers to deliver trillions of messages per day. They run a slightly modified version of Apache Kafka trunk. The [LinkedIn](https://github.com/linkedin/kafka) variant contains the LinkedIn Kafka release.

Assignment
==========

### **1. Contextualization of the Project**

[LinkedIn](https://github.com/linkedin/kafka) is a clone-and-own variant of 
[Apache Kafka]((https://github.com/apache/kafka)) that was created by copying and adapting the existing 
code of Apache Kafka that was forked on 2011-08-15T18:06:16Z. The two software systems kept on synchronizing 
their new updates until ```2022-06-02T17:08:43Z```. Since ```2022-06-02T17:08:43Z``` (divergence date), the two 
projects do not share common commits yet actively evolve in parallel. Currently, ( as of ```2025-10-01T15:01:39Z```), 
LinkedIn has 471 individual commits, and Apache Kafka has 7,199 individual commits. Development becomes 
redundant with the continued divergence, and maintenance efforts rapidly grow. For example, if a bug is 
discovered in a shared file and fixed in one variant, it is not easy to tell if it has been fixed in the 
other variant.

**General problem illustration**

The figure below illustrates clone-and-own, where variant2 (forked repository) was 
cloned-and-owned from ```Source Variant``` (original repository). When ```Target Variant``` forked by the 
developer  (```fork_date```), it inherited all commits from variant1. Then, between the 
```fork_date``` and ```divergence_date```, both variants synchronized commits, keeping both 
variants even. After the ```divergence_date```, the variants stopped synchronizing commits.

<img src="../../../images/problem.jpeg" alt="Patch" style="width:1000px;height:384px;" align="center">

Let us assume that the developer of ```variant1``` identified a bug after the 
```divergence_date``` in file `Foo.java`. The developer 
then decided to create a ```bufixing branch``` on the source 
repository, ```patched``` the ```buggy``` file, and finally integrated the ```patch```
back into the ```main branch``` of the ```Source Variant``` using a ```pull request```. 
When the maintainer of ```Target Variant``` wants to integrate the `bug fix` from the ```Source Variant``` into the ```git_head```,
there are two possible scenarios:

1. The commit will successfully integrate into the ```Target Variant```.
2. The commit will fail to integrate as a result of merge conflicts in the file `Foo.java`.

Since the fork has diverged, shared file(s) in a patch (pull request) may have changed between the 
source and target variants. As a result, direct `git cherry-pick` integration often produces **merge conflicts**. 
Some of these conflicts are purely textual, while others arise because of **refactoring operations** that 
were applied independently in the two variants (e.g., Apache Kafka vs. LinkedIn Kafka).  

In this course we use **[RePatch](https://github.com/Software-Reengineering/RePatch)**, 
which performs **refactoring-aware patch integration** by aligning source and target code 
around detected refactorings and replaying those changes.  

You have already seen how to run RePatch in the **Software Integration Lab** (Task 2 with PR #13386).  
For the project, you are expected to:  
- Reuse the same integration workflow shown in the lab, or follow the [RePatch README](https://github.com/Software-Reengineering/RePatch) for full instructions.  
- Inspect the results in the RePatch database (`merge_result`, `conflicting_files`, etc.) and document how conflicts were resolved, or why they could not be resolved.  
- Connect your observations back to reengineering patterns from the OORP book.  

### **2. Pull Request Categories**  

You will work on pull requests from the following four categories.  
[PR Categories Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2Y9p3mnBy5i_TP-7TNk2LkesAIsvoPma1MzAkU6WkA/edit?usp=sharing)  

Each student will analyze:  
- **Category 1:** 1 PR  
- **Category 2:** 2 PRs  
- **Category 3:** 1 PR  
- **Category 4:** 3 PRs  

Although each student is responsible for selecting and working on their PRs, you are expected to **collaborate as a team**.  
- Discuss your findings, challenges, and approaches together.  
- Share insights on conflicts, testing, and coverage.  
- Submit one **joint team report** that consolidates everyone’s contributions.  
- Inside the report, clearly **label which PRs were handled by each student** to ensure individual work is identifiable.   

#### Category 1: Cherry-pick succeeds and includes tests  

- Git cherry-pick succeeds without conflicts.  
- The integrated code is already covered by tests in the target repository.  

**Task:**
* Identify the **merge commit** of the patch pull request using techniques from the [Mining Software Respositories](/teaching/Software-Reengineering/msr/) class.
* Run `git cherry-pick` on the identified merge commit.
* Validate the integration by running the existing test suite.


#### Category 2: Cherry-pick succeeds but missing tests
- Git cherry-pick succeeds without conflicts.  
- Some of the changed files lack test in the target repository.

**Task:**
* Identify the **merge commit** of the patch pull request.
* Run `git cherry-pick` on the identified merge commit.
* Write the missing unit/integration tests for the uncovered changes.
* Measure coverage before and after adding the tests to ensure improvement.
 
#### Category 3: Cherry-pick fails, RePatch succeeds

* Git `cherry-pick` fails due to structural divergence.
* RePatch successfully resolves conflicts and integrates the PR.
* Some files may or may not have test coverage.

**Task:**
* Run RePatch and inspect the generated integration results to ensure correctness.
* Validate the integration by running the existing test suite.
* If tests are missing, write unit/integration tests for the uncovered changes.
* Measure coverage before and after adding tests to confirm improvement.


#### Category 4: Cherry-pick fails, RePatch cannot resolve conflicts

* Both Git `cherry-pick` and `RePatch` fail due to **unsupported refactorings** or **complex semantic/textual conflicts**.

**Task:**
* Identify and document the specific reason for failure (e.g., unsupported refactoring, semantic conflict, or other complex change).
* Attempt small,  e (e.g., updating a method signature, adding a missing parameter).
* If integration remains infeasible, clearly explain why developer intervention and domain knowledge are required.
* Reflect on the nature of these conflicts and discuss potential directions for extending or improving **RePatch** to handle them.

### **3. Getting Started Instructions**
Please pay attention to the following instructions:  

- Each group must prepare a **Pre-conditions Report** (PDF format).  
- Only **one member per group** should submit the report on Canvas on behalf of the group.  
- The report must include:  
  - The full names of all group members (maximum of 3 people per group; groups of 1–2 are also allowed).

* Your Pre-conditions Report should contain the following:
  * Project Name
  * Full names of all the members in your group
  * A link to your GitHub repositories (which shows you already forked [LinkedIn](https://github.com/linkedin/kafka)
  * The members are set as collaborators to the GitHub project.
  * Invite me as collaborator on your forked repositories. (my [GitHub ID - ```johnxu21```](https://github.com/johnxu21)).
* Demonstrate the ability to build the projects. For this, we want a statement from the group 
attesting they managed to successfully build the projects. You can also attach a screenshot of 
your IDE with the project source and a message like "build successful".
* Simple Class Diagram of one of the pull requests being patched (or buggy target). A simple class diagram has 
only the name of the class and its interactions with the other classes (there are two examples in 
[JPacman repository in the "docs" folder](https://github.com/johnxu21/jpacman/blob/master/doc/uml/FactoryWiring.png)). This is to reinforce your initial understanding of the 
system. You only need to focus on the classes associated with the patch and the classes that are 
called in those classes. There is no need to go deeper into the class structure (i.e., if buggy 
class calls Class X, and Class X calls Class Y, then you do not need to show Class Y since it is 
not being called directly by the buggy class). We are not going to evaluate your strictness to the 
proper UML notations, therefore focus on modeling and understanding classes interactions. 

### Pre-conditions Report  

Each group must submit a **Pre-conditions Report (PDF)**. Only one member should upload it on Canvas on behalf of the team.  

The report should include:  

#### 1. Group & Repository Setup  
- Project name  
- Full names of all group members  
- Link to your **forked LinkedIn Kafka repository**  
- Confirmation that all group members are added as collaborators  
- Add me as a collaborator on your fork (`GitHub ID: [johnxu21](https://github.com/johnxu21)`)  

#### 2. Build Confirmation  
- A short statement confirming that your group was able to **successfully build the project**  
- Each group member must include a **screenshot from their own IDE** showing the project source and a *“Build Successful”* (or equivalent) message  
- All screenshots should be compiled into the same PDF report  

#### 3. Initial System Understanding  
- Provide a **simple class diagram** for one of the pull requests you will work on (or the buggy target)  
- Focus only on:  
  - The class(es) affected by the patch  
  - The classes directly called by those classes  
- Do **not** include transitive dependencies (e.g., if Class A calls Class B, but Class B calls Class C, you don’t need to include Class C)  
- Strict UML notation is **not required** — clarity of interactions is the priority  
- See examples in the [JPacman repository (“docs” folder)](https://github.com/johnxu21/jpacman/blob/master/doc/uml/FactoryWiring.png)  

#### 4. Team Coordination (Optional)  
You may include a short plan for how your team will coordinate during the project.  
This is not graded, but it will help your group stay organized.  

Consider including:  
- **Meeting Schedule**: How often will you meet (weekly, bi-weekly)? Online or in person?  
- **Communication Tools**: Which tools will you use (Discord, Slack, email, GitHub issues)?  
- **Collaboration Practices**: How will you share progress on your assigned PRs (e.g., regular updates, peer reviews, or joint testing sessions)?  
- **Contingency Plan**: How will you handle missed deadlines, unresolved conflicts, or a teammate being unavailable?  


### **4. General Coding Instructions**

When working on this assignment, follow these repository and coding practices:  

* **Fork and Clone**  
  - Fork [LinkedIn Kafka](https://github.com/linkedin/kafka) and clone the source code for your team to work on.  
  - Refer to the project’s documentation for build instructions, but adapt as needed since open-source projects may have outdated documentation.  

* **Collaboration**  
  - Add all members as collaborators on the fork.  
  - Ensure that everyone has access to build, test, and push changes.  

* **Commit and Push Practices**  
  - Commit and push **regularly** with clear, descriptive messages.  
  - Each commit should represent a **single coherent activity** (e.g., resolving a conflict, adding tests, applying a patch).  
  - Avoid large commits that combine unrelated changes.  

* **Commit Message Guidelines**  
  - Write concise messages that explain the purpose of the change.  
  - Examples:  
    - `fixing merge conflicts on patch X, class Y`  
    - `adding unit tests for class Y`  
    - `refactoring class Y to apply patch + added new test`  
  - If possible, separate code changes and tests into different commits (this improves traceability).  

* **Commit History and Evaluation**  
  - Your GitHub commit history will be reviewed as part of the evaluation.  
  - A consistent, clear, and incremental history is expected.  
  - Make sure to commit and push the **final version** of your reengineering project before the deadline. 

### **5. Development Activities** 
For each assigned pull request (according to the four categories), perform the following activities and document them in your project report.  

----------
#### I. Design Recovery 


<center>
<img src="/images/473/design_recovery.jpeg" alt="Design Recover" style="width:500px;height:427px;" align="center">
</center>


- Describe the current design of the classes and methods affected by the pull request in the **target variant**.  
- Show how these classes fit into the broader architecture (e.g., their direct dependencies and interactions).  
- A simple class diagram is sufficient; focus on clarity, not UML formality.  

----------
#### II. Design Adaptation / Redesign 

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/images/473/Redesign.jpeg" alt="Redesign" style="width:450px;height:153px;" align="center">
</div>

- Analyze how the integrated change (patch) modifies or extends the existing design.  
- Compose a **revised design view** that shows how the functionality now fits into the system and interacts with related components.  
- If you wrote new tests, explain how the design of the test suite evolved to handle the change.  
- Confirm that the redesign supports the new feature/bug fix without degrading code quality.  

----------
#### III. Integration and Testing  
- Attempt to integrate the PR using `git cherry-pick`.  
- If cherry-pick fails, run **RePatch** and document the results.  
- Validate the integration by running the test suite of the target variant.  
- If tests are missing, write appropriate unit/integration tests.  
- Report **coverage before and after** integration and reflect on the adequacy of the test suite.  

----------
#### IV. Project management  

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/images/473/project-management.jpeg" alt="Project Management" style="width:550px;height:275px;" align="center">
</div>

- Estimate the effort required for:  
  - (i) integrating the patch, and  
  - (ii) creating/adapting tests.  
- Identify PRs that were **exceptional entities** (e.g., large number of files changed, complex conflicts).  
- Comment on risks to maintainability and potential long-term design debt introduced by the integration.  

--------
#### V. Refactoring and Manual Resolution 

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/images/473/refactor1.jpeg" alt="Project Management" style="width:400px;height:206px;" align="center">
</div>

- If RePatch cannot resolve conflicts, attempt **manual resolution** (e.g., adjusting parameters, handling renamed methods).  
- Document any **refactorings** you performed to make the integration feasible.  
- If manual resolution is not possible without developer intent, explain why.  
- Ensure tests remain effective and coverage is preserved after changes.  

----------

#### VI. Reflection on Patterns, Techniques, and Teamwork  

- Identify the **reengineering patterns** from the OORP book that informed your design, integration, testing, and refactoring decisions.  
- Reflect on how your team coordinated across categories (meetings, reviews, shared testing).  
- Summarize lessons learned about **design, variant-aware integration, and testing**.  

In addition, your report should demonstrate the use of techniques introduced in the lab sessions:  
- **Analyzing:** Metrics & Visualization; Mining Software Repositories.  
- **Restructuring:** Testing, Refactoring, and Integration.  

You are not required to use every technique, but you must **justify your choices**:  
- Explain why you applied certain techniques and why others were not relevant to your case.  
- Discuss the **benefits and drawbacks** of the chosen approaches.  
- You may also use alternative techniques or tools if they are better suited, but explain why.  

**Testing requirements:**  
- Determine how well the existing tests provide feedback for your refactoring and integration steps.  
- **Quantify adequacy** (e.g., show coverage before and after).  
- Argue whether the tests are sufficient for your chosen scenario.  
- If they are inadequate, adjust or extend them efficiently—balance thoroughness with time investment.  

--------

### **6. General Evaluation**  

To successfully complete the project, your report and implementation must demonstrate:  

* **Use of Reengineering Patterns**  
  - You can plan and select appropriate patterns from the OORP book to guide your activities.  
  - Your report explains which patterns were applied and why.  

* **Application of Analysis Techniques**  
  - You have applied one or more techniques from the lab sessions (e.g., code integration, mining software repositories, metrics & visualization, testing).  
  - Alternative techniques/tools are welcome, but you must justify their relevance.  
  - Evidence must be provided (e.g., screenshots, outputs, coverage reports, or metrics) along with your interpretation of the results.  

* **Execution of Project Activities**  
  - You have carried out the activities for each PR category (integration, testing, design recovery, redesign, refactoring/manual fixes).  
  - Your report explains the steps taken and the reasoning behind your decisions.  

* **Behavior-Preserving Restructuring**  
  - Refactorings and integrations do not break functionality.  
  - Demonstrate correctness by showing:  
    - The mapping between classes before and after changes.  
    - Successful compilation.  
    - Test results that pass consistently.  
    - Increased or maintained test coverage to support reliability.  

* **Design Justification**  
  - Your revised design clearly shows how the integrated patches fit into the system architecture.  
  - The design should improve or at least maintain code quality and system clarity.  
  - You are not required to perform every possible refactoring; instead, execute a representative set that illustrates your proposed solution.  

* **Quality of the Report**  
  - The report is clear, well-structured, and documents all steps of your work.  
  - Reasoning, evidence, and reflections must be included—not just raw results.  
  - Remember: the report is the primary artifact used for evaluation.  

For a detailed breakdown, consult the **evaluation checklist** available on the course main page.  


### **7. Report**  

This project is a **software reengineering process** applied to variant-aware patch integration.  
Your report should demonstrate how you applied reengineering concepts — analysis, design recovery, restructuring, and validation — in the context of the four PR categories.  

The following aspects must be addressed:  

* **Context**  
  - Briefly describe the context of your project: reengineering through patch integration across diverged variants (Apache Kafka → LinkedIn Kafka).  
  - Frame this as a reengineering challenge, not just a code merge.  

* **Problem at Hand**  
  - Clarify the reengineering problems encountered in PR integration (e.g., divergence, refactoring conflicts, missing tests).  
  - Discuss their intrinsic difficulties.  

* **Reengineering Patterns**  
  - Explicitly state the OORP patterns you selected and used.  
  - Explain how these patterns informed your analysis, design, integration, testing, and refactoring.  

* **Teamwork and Coordination**  
  - Describe how your team coordinated work across the four categories.  
  - Explain how responsibilities were managed, reviews conducted, and challenges addressed.  
  - Reflect on the effectiveness of your coordination strategy.  

* **Reengineering Patterns**  
  - You must show how OORP patterns guided your work.  
  - Do **not** list patterns in isolation; instead, introduce them in the context where they were applied:  
    - In **Design Recovery/Adaptation**: Which patterns helped you understand or adapt the architecture?  
    - In **Integration**: Which patterns helped you resolve conflicts or prioritize patches?  
    - In **Testing**: Which patterns informed how you verified correctness or extended the test suite?  
    - In **Refactoring**: Which patterns guided structural changes while preserving behavior?  
  - In your **reflection section**, briefly summarize which patterns were most useful across the categories and why.   

* **Reflection on Techniques**  
  - Discuss which analysis techniques from the labs (e.g., metrics, mining, visualization, integration tools, testing) were applied.  
  - Justify your choices and evaluate their benefits/drawbacks.  
  - Consider alternative techniques/tools where relevant.  

* **Conclusion**  
  - Summarize lessons learned about **software reengineering in the context of PR integration**.  
  - Highlight insights about design, testing, refactoring, and teamwork that extend beyond this specific case.  

**Note:** The **Intermediate Report** may cover partial progress with less detail. The **Final Report** should provide a full, polished account of your reengineering process. The **Pre-conditions Report** only ensures setup, but early planning on patterns and risks will strengthen your final outcome.  

Please also review the **Report Guidelines** and **Evaluation Checklist** on the course’s main page.
